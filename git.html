        <hr>
        <p>The GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that's great for teams and projects with regular deployments.</p>

            A <b>branch</b> is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch <br/> allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge <br/> your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.

            A <b>commit</b>, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a <br/> unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and <br/> when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

            A <b>pull requests</b> are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Merging</b> takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as <br/> a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via <br/> the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.
