        <h1><b>GitHub workflow</b></h1>
        <p>The GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that's great for teams and projects with regular deployments.</p>
        <img src="github flow.png" alt="Visual representation of the GitHub workflow, showing the main branch, how to create a feature branch from it and finally merge the changes from the feature into the main branch." height="375" width="700">
        <p>
            A <b>branch</b> is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without <br/> disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
            <br/>
            A <b>commit</b>, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that <br/> allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
            <br/>
            A <b>pull requests</b> are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.
            <br/>
            <b>Merging</b> takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), <br/>or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.

        <h1><b>Unix shell</b></h1>
        <p>A <b>Unix shell</b> is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some useful commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ls - lists the files in a directory</li>
                <li>pwd - shows the current working directory</li>
                <li>cd <i>dir</i> - changes directory to <i>dir</i></li>
                <li>cd .. - goes up a directory</li>
                <li>mkdir <i>dir</i> - makes directory <i>dir</i> </li>
                <li>touch <i>file1</i> - creates <i>file1</i></li>
                <li>rm <i>file1</i> - removes <i>file1</i></li>

            </ul>
